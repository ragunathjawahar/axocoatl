//! HITL (human-in-the-loop) interrupts.
//!
//! When an `Interrupt` node fires inside an automation, the executor:
//!
//!   1. Generates a fresh `run_id` if the automation didn't supply one.
//!   2. Resolves the node's `input` (the message shown to the operator).
//!   3. Registers a `PendingInterrupt` in the daemon's `pending_interrupts`
//!      map, keyed by `{automation_id}:{run_id}:{node_id}`.
//!   4. Emits a `StreamFrame::Event { event_type: "Interrupted" }` so the
//!      dashboard's activity feed lights up.
//!   5. Awaits `notify.notified()` — blocks until the operator resumes.
//!
//! `POST /api/automations/{id}/runs/{run_id}/resume` writes the resume value
//! into the matching `PendingInterrupt`, removes it from the map, and
//! signals the notify. The executor wakes and continues with the resumed
//! value as this node's output (or appended, per `ResumeStrategy`).
//!
//! Run IDs are random per execution — caller wires them through. We don't
//! persist them across daemon restarts in v0.1; a restart cancels any
//! pending interrupts. That's a known limitation paired with the
//! "checkpoint store" follow-up which would make resume durable.
