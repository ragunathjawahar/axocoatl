# Axocoatl Architecture

A practical overview of how Axocoatl runs and coordinates agents.

```

The **daemon** (`axocoatl-daemon`) bootstraps everything: providers, agents
(spawned as `ractor` actors), the event lattice, MCP connections, and the
activation loop. `axocoatl dev` adds a Unix-socket IPC server; `axocoatl serve`
exposes the HTTP API.

## Agents

Each agent is a `ractor` actor running `DefaultAgentBehavior`. On every turn:

1. Append input to **session memory** (Tier 1).
2. Build the request, injecting **long-term memory** (Tier 3) facts.
3. **Token budget** pre-flight check (`abort` / `warn` / `summarize`).
4. Call the agent's **provider** (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, …).
5. Run any **tool calls** (built-in or MCP) with hooks, up to 10 iterations.
6. **Checkpoint** the session to disk (Tier 2) for crash recovery.

On shutdown, agents distill the session into long-term memory facts.

## Token budgets

Per-agent `token_budget` with `per_call`, `per_execution`, and an
`overflow_policy`:

- `abort` — refuse the call and terminate the agent (no wasted tokens)
- `warn` — log and continue
- `summarize` — (compaction hook)

Budgets are checked **before** the LLM call, so an over-budget request never
costs tokens.

## Stigmergic coordination

The differentiator. Agents declare `depends_on`; the daemon registers each in
an `EventLattice` with a pheromone threshold:

- **Entry agents** (`depends_on: []`) — activated directly by
  `execute_workflow` with the user input.
- **Downstream agents** — threshold = `N × 0.5` where N = number of
  dependencies. Each upstream `TaskCompleted` event emits a signal of strength
  `0.5`; when accumulated signal crosses the threshold, the agent activates and
  receives its upstream outputs as context.

There is **no scheduler**. Coordination emerges from events:

```
execute_workflow → activate entry agent
   → agent completes → publish TaskCompleted
       → lattice raises downstream pheromone signals
           → threshold crossed → downstream agent activates
               → … → all expected agents done → workflow returns
```

A cycle guard (`max_activations = agents × 3`) and acyclic-DAG validation make
runaway activation impossible.

## Coordinator role

Alongside emergent lattice coordination, an agent can take the **coordinator**
role (`role: coordinator`) for explicit hierarchical decomposition. Each
coordination pass (`CoordinatorBehavior`):

1. **Decompose** the goal into subtasks. With HTN methods configured, planning
   is symbolic — an `HtnPlanner` expands compound tasks via its methods and an
   `LlmFrontierResolver` resolves only the frontiers the methods don't cover.
   Without methods, the LLM decomposes the whole goal. Each subtask carries the
   tools it needs.
2. **Assign** each subtask to a worker by **auction** (`compute_bid` /
   `run_auction`) — best fit by tool-capability match and remaining token
   budget. If no pooled worker can cover a subtask's tools, an ad-hoc worker is
   spawned with exactly those tools, so a subtask is never forced onto an unfit
   worker.
3. **Delegate** the pending subtasks to workers **in parallel**. Each worker is
   a first-class agent — its own tools, checkpoints, long-term + semantic
   memory, and hooks — with a run-scoped actor name so repeated runs never
   collide.
4. **Synthesize** the workers' outputs back into one answer to the original
   goal, accounting for any subtasks that failed.

The pass is **resumable**: the plan and each completed subtask are checkpointed
(`OrchestrationState`), so a crash mid-run resumes where it left off instead of
re-doing finished work. Workers are always torn down after a pass — on success
and on every error path — so no actor or task leaks, and a fully failed worker
set surfaces an error rather than a hollow result. The underlying primitives
(`axocoatl-coordination`: lattice, HTN, auction) run in sub-microsecond time and
are independently tested.

## Memory tiers

| Tier | What | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Session | conversation transcript | in-memory |
| 2 — Checkpoint | agent state snapshots | disk (pruned to 3) |
| 3 — Long-term | distilled facts | disk (bincode) |
| 4 — Semantic | neural vector recall | disk (embeddings) |

Tier 4 runs a pure-Rust neural embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim) on
Candle — the ~90 MB model is downloaded once, with a feature-hash fallback when
it's unavailable. No external service, no network at inference time.

## Protocols

- **MCP** — the daemon connects to configured `mcp_servers` (stdio or
  streamable-http) at bootstrap and exposes their tools to agents. Axocoatl is
  also an MCP **server**: `axocoatl mcp serve` runs over stdio and exposes each
  agent as an `agent_<id>` tool.
- **A2A** — agent-to-agent interop for cross-framework workflows, reachable over
  `GET /.well-known/agent.json` and `POST /a2a/tasks`.

## Security model

A session runs the agent's tools inside a **rootless, daemonless Podman
container**, not on the host. The threat model is deliberately narrow, and
stated plainly so you know what it does and doesn't cover.

**What the sandbox contains — the blast radius of a mistaken or misbehaving
agent:**

- **Filesystem.** Only the session's working directory is bind-mounted into the
  container (`{dir}:{dir}:rw`). Nothing else of the host is visible — not your
  home directory, SSH keys, or sibling projects. A destructive command
  (`rm -rf`, a bad `git reset`) can only reach that one directory.
- **Privileges.** The container runs with `--security-opt=no-new-privileges` and
  drops the escape/recon capabilities (`SYS_ADMIN`, `SYS_PTRACE`, `NET_ADMIN`,
  `NET_RAW`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH`, …), so a setuid binary can't escalate and the
  classic namespace/mount escape levers are gone.
- **Network.** Untrusted runs start with `--network none` — no outbound
  connections at all. Bridged networking is opt-in, per policy.
- **Resources.** Memory, CPU, and PID caps (2 GB / 2 CPUs / 512 pids) bound a
  runaway loop or fork bomb, where the host's cgroup delegation allows it.

**What it does NOT solve — and we won't pretend otherwise:**

- **Prompt injection.** If the agent reads malicious instructions from a file, a
  web page, or tool output, the sandbox does not stop it from *acting* on them
  inside its workspace and its allowed network. Isolation bounds the blast
  radius; it is not a defense against an agent being talked into the wrong
  thing. Keep secrets out of the workspace and prefer `--network none` for
  untrusted inputs.
- **Host kernel / Podman bugs.** Container isolation is only as strong as the
  host kernel and Podman underneath it. A kernel-level container-escape CVE is
  outside our control.
- **What you explicitly grant.** Bridged networking, mounted credentials, or a
  permissive tool policy widen the surface — by your choice.
