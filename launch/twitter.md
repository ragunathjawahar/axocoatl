We just shipped Axocoatl v0.1.0 — an open-source agentic runtime in
Rust.

Real workflows. No theater.

One 25 MB binary. Your hardware, your LLM, your data.

What it's actually for:

Most agent tooling optimizes for the aesthetic of AI work — chat
interfaces, demo videos, glowing terminals.

Axocoatl optimizes for the unglamorous reality. Agents that run for
months, persist state, follow real workflows, and finish the work.

What that looks like in practice:

– A runtime, not a framework
– Actor-supervised, checkpointed agents
– Stigmergic event lattice for coordination (no central scheduler)
– Survives restarts via hot checkpoints
– Runs as a system service

## Tweet 4

The lattice is the part I'm most proud of.

Agents declare `depends_on` and publish events when they finish work.
Downstream agents activate when their thresholds are crossed.

No orchestrator. The DAG is whatever the dependency graph implies.

Provider matrix is wide:

– Ollama (default, local)
– OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Gemini
– OpenRouter (every model behind one key)

Each agent picks its own. Local model for cheap classification,
frontier model for the one agent that needs it.

Memory is four-tier, hot to cold:

1. Session (in-process)
2. Checkpoint (durable snapshots)
3. Long-term (key/value)
4. Semantic (neural — embedded BERT via Candle, pure Rust)

All local. No data leaves your box unless you wire it to.

Dashboard is vanilla HTML + Web Components, no React.

Sessions cockpit, Studio lattice canvas, Automations editor, Chat,
Files, Skills, MCP. macOS Finder–shaped because that's what a real
control panel looks like.

## Tweet 8

Concrete workflows we're running:

– Release notes drafted every Monday at 9am
– Support triage on incoming email
– Daily briefings landing in inbox at 8am
– Bug bisection in directory sessions
– Contract review on uploads

Real workflows. Not demos.

## Tweet 9

The runtime is Apache-2.0. Zero telemetry. Air-gappable.

If you want to try it:

  curl -fsSL https://axocoatl.ai/install.sh | sh
