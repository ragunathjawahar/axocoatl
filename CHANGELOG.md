# Changelog

All notable changes to Axocoatl are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Tool calling on the OpenAI and Anthropic providers.** Both built the
  outbound chat request without attaching the tool definitions, so models on
  these providers never received the available tools and could not make tool
  calls — only the Ollama provider sent tools. OpenAI now attaches converted
  tools via a shared `build_chat_request` used by both `chat` and `chat_stream`;
  Anthropic attaches `tools` in `build_request_body`. Adds regression tests
  asserting the tool definitions reach the request.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-24

First public release. The framework is functional end-to-end with a real LLM
(local via Ollama, or any configured provider).

### Added
- **Stigmergic multi-agent coordination**: EventLattice with pheromone-signal
  activation, HTN symbolic planning, and auction-based agent selection wired
  into the daemon. Agents in a workflow self-activate via a `depends_on` DAG —
  no central orchestrator.
- **Workflow execution**: `axocoatl workflow list|run`, `POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute`,
  and IPC support. Entry agents activate directly; downstream agents cascade
  via `TaskCompleted` events.
- **Full command surface** — previously stubbed commands now functional:
  `tokens report`, `agents status`, `agents restart`, `mcp servers`, `mcp tools`.
- **MCP integration**: daemon connects to configured MCP servers at bootstrap
  (stdio + streamable-http transports).
- **Developer experience**: `axocoatl onboard` interactive setup wizard and
  `axocoatl doctor` environment health check.
- **Distribution**: one-line install script and prebuilt binaries for Linux,
  macOS, and Windows; published to crates.io.
- Root `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, user-facing
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

### Changed
- Workspace and all crates renamed from **Nexus** to **Axocoatl**.
- Version bumped from `0.0.1` (name-reservation placeholder) to `0.1.0`
  (first real release).
- Examples are now part of the workspace build and each has a README.

### Fixed
- Workflow coordination bug where the initial `UserInput` event spuriously
  activated downstream agents in parallel instead of cascading after their
  dependencies completed.
- `LICENSE` copyright attribution corrected to "Axocoatl Contributors".
- Zero compiler warnings across the workspace.
